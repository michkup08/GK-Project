Going well, is it, buddy? Look you do, like nothing to do you have, and bored you are. 
An interesting mission for ninjas seeking adventure, I have. Himself a new clock, 
my neighbor Andrzej has just gotten. A thief he is. 
As well we know, theft from a thief, theft it is not. 
In a village behind the mountains, behind the forests he lives, 
guarded by dangerous guys with axes. Wasted, a clock of this quality cannot be. 
With regret, accept it I will.
