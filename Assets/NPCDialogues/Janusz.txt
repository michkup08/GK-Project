Howdy, man
You look like a warrior without weapons to me. Would you like to change that?
I happen to have something pretty good, but nothing comes for free.
It so happens that my neighbor Andrzej from a nearby village has a new clock.
If you stole it, I'd be happy to swap it, go through this gate and you'll find it somehow.
