Great Ninja, I need you to take out some barbarians that are scaring my farm with goats and sheep. They are located between a lake of blue tears and a desert of green cacti. There are four of these vandals, but they have sharp axes, so be careful. Collect bright orbs along the way - they will give you power. Once you take care of them, come to my farm. Good luck
