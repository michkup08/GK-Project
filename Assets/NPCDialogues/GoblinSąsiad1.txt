I got really drunk yesterday. I smoked blunts until five in the morning. The movie stopped while I was lying in the tube. 
Now cross #!$%@? I slept a bit, but I had to get up in the morning because I had responsibilities. 
I have a baby. Some people say you can't drink when you have children, but that's not true. 
You can, you just have to get up in the morning. That's what responsibility is.
