Hail, I stand as the guardian of the ancient temple.
I am bestowed with the duty to permit only the chosen one to enter the temple and gather the final fragments of the light.
Verily, the temple is fraught with perils, such as rivers of fire. To navigate through, one must also scale the walls,
thus, a rope must be in thy possession. However, tidings from my sister-in-arms have reached me, proclaiming thou art well equipped for this quest.
Hence, fortune favor thee and may the light guide thy path.
