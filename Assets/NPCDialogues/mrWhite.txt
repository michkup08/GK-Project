Jesse, listen to me. You belong here, right now. This barrel is our only way out. 
If we can't get its contents onto the camper without attracting attention, we are done for. 
The police are looking for us, and we can't afford to make a mistake. 
Please, help me. This needs to be an immediate and silent operation. 
We will handle this together, as we always do. 
I know it's hard, but we have no choice. 
Everything we have worked for, everything we have risked, depends on this moment. 
Jesse, I’m counting on you. Will you help me?
